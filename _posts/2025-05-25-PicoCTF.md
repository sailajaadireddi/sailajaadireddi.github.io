# PicoCTF Challenges-Medium

## GUESS MY CHEESE (PART 1)
![HashCrack Screenshot](/assets/lib/pic1.png)

### Hints :
Remember that cipher we devised together Squeexy? The one that incorporates your affinity for linear equations???

## Transposition-trail

The file contains 
```
heTfl g asiicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V091B0AE}2
```
now use hint 
Split the 
#### msg into blocks of 3 ####
By observing the scrambled message, we can infer that the first 2 words of the message should be 
#### “The flag”. ####
Let’s zoom into the first 3 blocks (of 3), which will make up the first 2 words.
```
•	First block: heT
•	Second block: fl
•	Third block: g a
```
So From the above 3 blocks. 
we can conclude that the third character of each block should be the first. This will be followed by the first and second character of the block.

### Decrypted message: 
```
The flag is picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_56E6924A}
```

This is the cipher given to us and a key, we are gonna use the process of solving vignere cipher. First method can be using the online decoder for a vignere cipher
in the key we have put 'CYLAB' and encrypted our main code

The Flag:
```
picoCTF{D0NT_US3_V1G3N3R3_C1PH3R_2951a89h}
```

### Hints:
 #### Try a frequency attack
#### Do the punctuation and the individual words help you make any substitutions?
This is the msg given

Use CyberChef to manually break the substitution cipher.

Flag:
```
PICOCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_7AA384BC}

# Pixelated

# Description
I have these 2 images, can you make a flag out of them?
scrambled1.png scrambled2.png

# Hints
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cryptography
Think of different ways you can “stack” images

# Solution
We can use the concept of visual cryptography to solve this problem.
```
Visual Cryptography is a cryptographic technique where an image is divided into multiple shares (or layers) so that individually, they reveal no information. However, when these shares are overlaid or stacked together, the original image or secret can be visually reconstructed without needing a computer—just the human eye
```

so basically, we need to combine two photos that were given to us in order to retrieve the original image.
I wrote a Python code using chatGPT for this purpose:
```
from PIL import Image

def combine_images(image1_path, image2_path, output_path):
    # Open the images
    image1 = Image.open(image1_path)
    image2 = Image.open(image2_path)

    # Ensure both images have the same size
    if image1.size != image2.size:
        raise ValueError("Images must have the same size")

    # Combine the images using a simple averaging technique
    combined_image = Image.blend(image1, image2, alpha=0.5)

    # Save the combined image
    combined_image.save(output_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Provide the paths of the input images and the desired output path
    image1_path = "scrambled1.png"
    image2_path = "scrambled2.png"
    output_path = "combined_image.png"

    combine_images(image1_path, image2_path, output_path)
```

  this is what i got after running the code:

  After Zooming it in a website  https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier

  I can see the flag is:
```
  picoCTF{1b867c3e}
```

# john_pollard

## Description
Sometimes RSA certificates are breakable

## Hints:
The flag is in the format picoCTF{p,q}
Try swapping p and q if it does not work

## Solution

they had given a cetificate 
we need to find p and q from the certificate
so i decoded it using https://8gwifi.org/PemParserFunctions.jsp

Find the modulus value in the decoded certificate.
```
Modulus:966306421059967 
```
To solve this challenge, we need to find the prime factors of the RSA modulus `n`. 
We can use [Alpertron](https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM) to find the prime factors of `n`.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{73176001,67867967}
```

# waves over lambda
## Description
We made alot of substitutions to encrypt this. Can you decrypt it? Connect with nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 32282.

## Hints:
Flag is not in the usual flag format

## Solution:
![HashCrack Screenshot](/assets/encrypt.png)

Run the above encrypted one in https://www.quipqiup.com/ to get the following:

![HashCrack Screenshot](/assets/lib/flag.png)

So here is the Flag as per hint:
```
frequency_is_c_over_lambda_
```
