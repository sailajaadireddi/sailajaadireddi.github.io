Hey there!


Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I jot down CTF writeups, tricky challenges, and random cybersecurity stuff I stumble upon.

I do this to keep track of my journey, share what I’ve learned, and maybe help out others who are stuck like I was.

This blog’s for me, for beginners, and for anyone curious about the hacking side of things.
Proudly repping my team — Hacker Troupe 💪

“My CTF notebook — just less messy.”
